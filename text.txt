reate code python about on google colab : IMAGES CLASSIFICATION 

The primary aim of this project is to design, implement, and evaluate an
effective image classification model for categorizing images into distinct
classes using pretrained models.

-> Take any the dataset from Kaggle about ( images classification)

DATASETS : 

Project Ideas:
1- Emotion Recognition
2- Age Detection
3- Pet Breed Classification
4-Traffic Sign Recognition
5- Medical Image Classification (specify the disease)
6- Trash Classification for Recycling
7- Bird Species Identification
8 - Real and AI generated images

STEPS :
1 - Load the dataset take in Error handling if the dataset is load Done then print error  

2 - Split the dataset

3 - Apply the necessary Import the dataset and preprocess the images (scaling and
augmentation).

4 - After your Split and preprocessing the data make plot 3 simple the dataset 

=====================================================

5 - Train and compare the performance of these pretrained models
(EfficientNet/Resnet/MobileNet)

6- Create model checkpoints and implement early stopping

7 - Training the models on the Training set.

8- Compare between the optimizers in tensorflow by plotting the
training loss curves.

9- Generate a confusion matrix if number of classes <= 10 classes.
10- Otherwise compare the F1-scores of each class if classes >10.
11- Give your model a new image to predict it.

12 - print the Accuracy and optimizer 
13 - Evaluate the trained models on the Testing set and compare the evaluation metrics
(Loss and Accuracy) among the model for each optimizer.

14 - Plot four figures for U-net model:
o Figure-1: depicting train loss for the model
o Figure-2: depicting validation or test loss for the model
o Figure-3: depicting train accuracy for the model
o Figure-4: depicting validation or test accuracy for the model
â€¢ Show your display results  that includes the final training and validation Loss and
Accuracy of the ten model as follows:

-> model
-> optimizer 
-> train loss
-> Train Acc
-> Validation or test Loss 
-> Validation or test Acc

=================================================

i need you put the simple comments and mack sure create function without function main

i need you print the confusion matrix and F1 

step by step
